## Programming languages
Python for UI. <br />
Game logic and AI in C.

## Build System
To be decided. Currently VSC (Visual Studio Code) extension programs are being utilized. More precisely Microsofts CMake Tools extension. Users are in addition expected to have a C-compiler installed. For example, The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), which includes The C Standard Library, The GNU Project Debugger  (GDB), and the "build tool" GNU MAKE.
